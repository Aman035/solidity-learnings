# What's It About ?

Welcome to the Solidity Basics directory! Here, I have curated a handful of fundamental concepts in Solidity that I found essential to practice or to experiment with.
If you are learning solidity or even revising, you should take a look at resources that I refered to.
All the codes above were practiced on Remix IDE.

## Resources Referenced

**Note For Self** - Resources will be marked as optional which I feel can be skipped for revising. Unmarked resources should be considered as mandatory.
