# What's It about ?

Welcome to the Solidity Basics directory! Here, I have curated a handful of fundamental concepts in Solidity that I found essential to practice or to experiment with.
If you are learning solidity or even revising, you should take a look at resources that I refered to.
All the codes above were practiced on Remix IDE.
